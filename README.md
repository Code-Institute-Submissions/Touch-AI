This is a project website for a fictional comapany called AI Touch. They develop Point of sale software for the retail and Hospitality trade.
And what really makes AI Pos stand out against its competitors in the Point of Sale sector, is its clever use of AI(Artificial Intelligence) and ML(Machine Learning)


## UX


This project will be submitted for my User Centric Front End Development and first milestone project, in my Full Stack Software Development course. The project will produce a working static front-end website, demonstrating the technologies i have learned so far.

AI Touch need a B2B website that will reflect their professional standards and the respectable image they have achieved.

The website will be primarily aimed at the POS dealer maket, not the end user.
The goal of the website will be to build a partner network of dealers. The website will be a source of clear and accurate information, that builds confidence, and encourages them to request a demo pack, or otherwise make contact.

The Website must contain all information relevant to the features of the Software. It must also promote the companys emphasis on Backup support - as priority - in the companys philosophy, and the means by which it achieves this.

The information must obviously be accurate, and presented in a clear and concise manor.

_( "keep it simple, stupid" - U.S. Navy 1960)_

The visitor to the website will almost certainly have, or will intend to visit and compare other websites and products. So being transparent and informative above and beyond the need is an experience that will remain with the visitor.



ultimatly for the first release we will use the above table to target the most feasible elements.
