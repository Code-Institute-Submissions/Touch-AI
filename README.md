This is a project website for a fictional comapany called AI Touch. They develop Point of sale software for the retail and Hospitality trade.
And what really makes AI Pos stand out against its competitors in the Point of Sale sector, is its clever use of AI(Artificial Intelligence) and ML(Machine Learning)


## UX


This project will be submitted for my User Centric Front End Development and first milestone project, in my Full Stack Software Development course. The project will produce a working static front-end website, demonstrating the technologies i have learned so far.

---

AI Touch need a B2B website that will reflect their professional standards and the respectable image they have achieved.

The website will be primarily aimed at the POS dealer maket, not the end user.
The goal of the website will be to build a partner network of dealers. The website will be a source of clear and accurate information, that builds confidence, and encourages them to request a demo pack, or otherwise make contact.

The Website must contain all information relevant to the features of the Software. It must also promote the companys emphasis on Backup support - as priority - in the companys philosophy, and the means by which it achieves this.

The information must obviously be accurate, and presented in a clear and concise manor.

_( "keep it simple, stupid" - U.S. Navy 1960)_

The visitor to the website will almost certainly have, or will intend to visit and compare other websites and products. So being transparent and informative above and beyond the need is an experience that will remain with the visitor.

## User Stories 

* As a user i want to easily find the information i want.
* As a user i want to gain in-depth information from the website.
* As a user i want to feel that the company is reputable.
* As a user i want to know that i can easily and reliably contact someone.
* As management i want a professional responsive online presence.
* As management i want an accurate point of information quickly and easily accessible for partners.
* As management i want to showcase our philosophy of support first.
* As tech support i want to see how are services can be showcased to the clients.

## Wireframe mockups:
I made these of a medium fidelity, deliberatly leaving out promo images as they have not been finalised: I included some colour to test the appearance.

# Considered styling

### HTML: 

Used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) extensively throughout the HTML, with some [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) also. This is due to the ease and speed achievable with bootstrap.

### CSS:

Really wanted to make the css as lightweight as i possibly could. Studied new naming methods like BEM, but decided not to use it for this project, instead i will stick with solid simple but descriptive class names.

### Colours:

Strong purple [#2e151b](https://www.google.com/search?q=%232e151b&oq=%232e151b&aqs=chrome..69i57.849j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) with a light contrasting pink [#da7b93](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23da7b93&oq=%23da7b93&aqs=chrome..69i57.415j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), will be the main themed colors of the site, matching with the own-styled logo.
A white center trunk when the screen is expanded to deskto type sizes, will then contrast nicely with the [#555555](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02sJ9VZ3SKReOpg0FJiev_ZayEg2A%3A1588278616107&ei=WDWrXqGdBpup1fAP-ZqXiA8&q=%23555555&oq=%23555555&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoICAAQBRAKEB46BAgAEB46BggAEAUQHjoHCAAQFBCHAjoCCAA6BQgAEIMBOgQIABADUJiaCVjVtAlgprkJaABwAHgAgAFziAHoB5IBBDEyLjKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwihqd71_pDpAhWbVBUIHXnNBfEQ4dUDCAw&uact=5) text

# Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page.
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
   
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.



# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?
  
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
