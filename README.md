This is a project website for a fictitious company called Touch AI. They develop Point of sale software for the retail and Hospitality trade.
And what really makes this Touch AI Website stand out against its competitors in the Point of Sale sector, is its direct clear information and uncluttered fresh layout.


## UX


This project will be submitted for my User Centric Front End Development and first milestone project, in my Full Stack Software Development course. The project will produce a working static front-end website, demonstrating the technologies I have learned so far.

---

Touch AI need a B2B website that will reflect their professional standards and the respectable image they have achieved.

The website will be primarily aimed at the POS dealer market, not the end user.
The goal of the website will be to build a partner network of dealers. The website will be a source of clear and accurate information, that builds confidence, and encourages them to request a demo pack, or otherwise make contact.

The Website must contain all information relevant to the features of the Software. It must also promote the company emphasis on Backup support - as priority - in the company philosophy, and the means by which it achieves this.

The information must obviously be accurate, and presented in a clear and concise manner.

_( "keep it simple, stupid" - U.S. Navy 1960)_

The visitor to the website will almost certainly have, or will intend to visit and compare other websites and products. So being transparent and informative above and beyond the need is an experience that will remain with the visitor.

## User Stories 

* As a user I want to easily find the information I want.
* As a user I want to gain in-depth information about the products benefits from the website.
* As a user I want to feel that the company is reputable.
* As a user I want to know that I can easily and reliably contact someone.
* As management I want a professional responsive online presence.
* As management i want existing partners to be promoted.
*  As management i want the versatilityof our software to be promoted.
* As management I want an accurate point of information quickly and easily accessible for potential partners.
* As management I want to showcase our philosophy of support first.
* As tech support I want to see how are services and efforts can be showcased to the clients.

## Wireframe mock-ups:
I made these of a medium fidelity, deliberately leaving out promo images as they have not been finalized: I included some colour to test the appearance.

# Considered execution and styling

### DESIGN:

The Hero image i designed to draw the attention with the opaque overlay of the eye, which does make the user take a 2nd look, and is visually appealing. An offset of the main area is deliberatly overlapping the hero image so the visitor will be curious to scroll down.

Once the page is scrolled down, i want the Navbar to disappear, with all the cta buttons on each section, i feel there is no need for a fixed navigation. 

I wanted a very clear whitespace, with a flow that invites you down the page, and draws your attention with offset images and unboxed content. A clean uncluttered experience, that provides brief but informative overviews of the product, rather than overpower. But then invites you to __*learn more*__, to find out more information, and eventually to achieve the goal, which is to make contact via the form on the contact page.

The information will be organised in a manner that both recognises the clients needs and makes logical sense. With the core of the page given up to promoting the product in a Benefits section, it will be padded top and bottom by a partner promotional carousel and a service dept promotion via some news blogs, which will satisfy the main demands on the Website.

A common footer with Navigation and cta button will complete the layout.

Sub pages will adopt the same styling as the Benefits section, with the contact page having a form layout.



### HTML: 

Intention to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) extensively throughout the HTML, with some [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) also. This is due to the ease and speed at which you can layout and space objects with bootstrap.

### CSS:

* **Stylesheet:** A single style sheet will provide style for all pages.
The aim was to make the css as lightweight as possible, using more left to right html built in bootstrap classes and re-using own style classes, to position and style items. 

* Studied new **naming methods** like BEM, but decided not to use it for this project, instead I will stick with solid simple but descriptive class names.
  
* **Fonts** The site has to be clear and simple, There must be nothing confusing, and so i chose simple clear fonts : **Poppins and Roboto**.

* **Sizing:** Decided to use REM sizing for fonts, as i personally find it easier to keep the sizes uniform accross the site.

* **Colours:** Strong purple [#2e151b](https://www.google.com/search?q=%232e151b&oq=%232e151b&aqs=chrome..69i57.849j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) with a light contrasting pink [#da7b93](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23da7b93&oq=%23da7b93&aqs=chrome..69i57.415j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), will be the main themed colours of the site, matching with the own-styled logo. Purple is the color of royalty, luxury, power, wisdom, and creativity, wheras pink is a confident color.
A white center trunk when the screen is expanded to desktop type sizes, will then contrast nicely with the [#424242](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02sJ9VZ3SKReOpg0FJiev_ZayEg2A%3A1588278616107&ei=WDWrXqGdBpup1fAP-ZqXiA8&q=%23424242&oq=%23424242&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoICAAQBRAKEB46BAgAEB46BggAEAUQHjoHCAAQFBCHAjoCCAA6BQgAEIMBOgQIABADUJiaCVjVtAlgprkJaABwAHgAgAFziAHoB5IBBDEyLjKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwihqd71_pDpAhWbVBUIHXnNBfEQ4dUDCAw&uact=5) text.

### Images:

* All images used are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

* **Hero image:** Layered 2 images together using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/)  to include the subtle eye, to achieve a more catching hero image. Added a light pink opaque overlay to provide better contrast with hero text.

## Features Left to Implement in future releases

* A further set of pages relating to the individual products in more specific detail. This would branch off from the current Hospitality and Retail sections, into more specific areas such as Handheld ordering, Online sales, Kitchen Printing/Video ordering etc. With links back to case studies where Touch AI, helped to solve a problem with its software.

*  To be more useful as a point of information, a more specific downloads section or FAQ site would be useful for downloading brouchures, spec sheets etc.
  
* A Blog page, i feel that news stories and case studies of partner intallations and similar news stories does create a more solid online image, and creates confidence.

# Issues during development:

 **Trying to implement the centre white column in larger screen sizes**:
  
I had planned to use an absolute positioned block, with the rest of the page rendered on top. What I found was that when resizing the screen (zooming) the absolute block would not resize in the expected manner, and any of the content would have needed a position relative to appear on top of the absolute div. Therefore, it seemed like the wrong or messy way to do it. 
I therefore decided to use the main section and style it white, and set the offset conten(pictures) to have negative margins.

**Getting Offset images to collapse at correct size:**

Had some trouble making the expanding offset images responsive on the way down screen sizes. As i have set my white center div to be 1200px wide, that corresponds to the bootstrap 1200px breakpoint.

Therefore there is a tiny window between 1260px and 1200px where my images would not collapse properly.

### Initial testing:

#### Responsivness:

This was done using Google chrome developer tools, for the initial stages


Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page.
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
   
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.



# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?
  
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
